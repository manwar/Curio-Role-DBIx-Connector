# NAME

Curio::Role::DBIx::Connector - Build Curio classes around DBIx::Connector.

# SYNOPSIS

Create a Curio class:

```perl
package MyApp::Service::DB;

use Curio role => '::DBIx::Connector';
use strictures 2;

key_argument 'key';
export_function_name 'myapp_db';

add_key 'writer';
add_key 'reader';

has key => (
    is       => 'ro',
    required => 1,
);

sub dsn {
    my ($self) = @_;
    return myapp_config()->{db}->{ $self->key() }->{dsn};
}

sub username {
    my ($self) = @_;
    return myapp_config()->{db}->{ $self->key() }->{username};
}

sub password {
    my ($self) = @_;
    return myapp_secret( $self->key() . '_' . $self->username() );
}

sub attributes {
    return { PrintError=>1 };
}

1;
```

Then use your new Curio class elsewhere:

```perl
use MyApp::Service::DB qw( myapp_db );

my $db = myapp_db('writer')->connector();

$db->run(sub{
    $_->do( 'CREATE TABLE foo ( bar )' );
});
```
